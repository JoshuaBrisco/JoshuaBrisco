Hi there, I'm Joshua Brisco 👋
I’m a Pharm.D-trained individual with a passion for coding and technology. I’m excited to blend my knowledge in healthcare with my interest in programming.

🚀 About Me:
👀 I'm interested in pharmacy, continuous learning, and technology, and I love solving problems.
🌱 Currently, I’m learning Python to build my skills in coding and software development using the app Mimo.
🤝 I’m open to collaborating on projects, especially those that bridge pharmacy and tech.
